                My name is John Ryan, I have been many things in my life. Chef, butcher, firefighter, teacher, and now I am moving into web development.
                I enjoy understanding the roots of problems and finding a solution that is not only serviceable but also elegant.
                My past work history has taught me how to budget my time, understand and break down complex problems into their component parts, and how to deal with pressure.
                Honestly, as challenging as javascript can be, it doesnâ€™t compare with falling through a burning roof on the stress scale. 
            	I hope you enjoy looking through my past projects. Please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have about my work. I hope you like what I have to show you.
